1. Give a high-level description of your server’s design.

2. What difficulties did you face and how did you solve them?

3. Include a brief manual in the report to explain how to compile and run your source code
(if TAs cannot compile and run your source code by reading your manual, the project is
considered not to be finished).

4. Include and briefly explain some sample outputs of your client-server (e.g. in Part A you
should be able to see an HTTP request). You do not have to write a lot of details about the
code, but just adequately comment your source code. The cover page of the report should
include the name of the course and project, your partner’s name, and student ID.
